1- The United Nations has announced a new climate action plan to reduce global carbon emissions by 45% before 2030. Leaders emphasized the urgency of transitioning to renewable energy sources and investing in sustainable technologies. Critics, however, argue that without stronger enforcement mechanisms, countries may fail to meet their commitments.

2- Pakistan and Bangladesh signed six agreements in various areas of cooperation on Sunday as Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar made a historic visit to Dhaka to build on the reset in ties.
Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
The Foreign Office has termed two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations.
Following delegation-level talks between Dar and Bangladesh Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain in Dhaka today, both leaders oversaw the signing of “six instruments”, Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said in a statement.
These included an agreement on visa abolition for diplomatic and official passport holders, as well as a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on a Joint Working Group on trade.
Pakistan and Bangladesh had agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side last month, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka.
An MoU was also signed between the Foreign Service academies of both countries, while another MoU was inked between the Associated Press of Pakistan and the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha to further media cooperation.
In the domain of academics, an MoU was signed between the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad and Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies, while a cultural exchange programme was also agreed upon.
“These agreements will institutionalise and further strengthen the bilateral cooperation in trade and economics, training of diplomats, academic exchanges, media cooperation and cultural exchanges,” the FO statement highlighted.
